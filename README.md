# Paid4Chores

1. Tap "+" to add a child to the list
2. Tap your child's name to increase their payment tally in $0.25 increments
3. Tap your child's payment tally to "zero" it out (note: you will have to pay them with cash - this app doesn't pay them for you!)

Note: There currently isn't functionality to delete children. I may add this later - or just don't "delete" your kids! ;)
